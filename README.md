node-boilerplate
================

First of all.. This is not ( and i think it never will be ) any kind of framework! It's just a project template.

If you want to use this code, you should keep in your mind, that my primary template engine is EJS - well, perhaps i could change it into handlebars in the near future, but... It will never be some weird Jade or something, and as far as i will try to my best to test this 'project project template' with other template engines, i can't guarantee anything here...

TODO:
- scaffolding using Jugglingdb and Twitter Bootstrap
- google closure compiler for all client JS files (how can we deal with shared JS code after 'compilation'?)
- ...
