node-boilerplate
================

If you want to use this code, you should keep in your mind, that my primary template engine is EJS - well, perhaps i could change it into handlebars in the near future, but... It will never be some weird Jade or something, and as far as i will try to my best to test this 'project project template' with other template engines, i can't guarantee anything here...

Pull requests are always welcome ;-)
